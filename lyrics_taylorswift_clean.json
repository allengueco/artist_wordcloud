 "lyrics": "The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nWhen the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst\nIt was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nYou're still all over me\nLike a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore\n\nHung my head as I lost the war\nAnd the sky turned black like a perfect storm\n\nRain came pouring down\nWhen I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe\nAnd by morning\nGone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh)\n\nThere was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nWhen the butterflies turned to\nDust that covered my whole room\nSo I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nLet the flood carry away all my pictures of you\n\nThe water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud\nBut no one heard a thing\nRain came pouring down\nWhen I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe\nAnd by morning\nGone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh)\nI think I am finally clean\n(Oh, oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh\nSaid, I think I am finally clean\n(Oh, oh)\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh\n\nTen months sober, I must admit\nJust because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it\nTen months older, I won't give in\nNow that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it\n\nThe drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\nWhen the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst\n(Oh)\n\nThe rain came pouring down\nWhen I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe\nAnd by morning\nGone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean\nRain came pouring down\nWhen I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe\nAnd by morning\nGone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean\n(Oh, oh)\nFinally clean\nThink I'm finally clean\n(Oh, oh)\nOh-oh, oh-oh\n(Oh, oh, oh)\nThink I'm finally clean149EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
